# Hi, I'am Judith
my first project is to do a "About Me" page, so here I am!
Trying to get organised to not waste time as there is a lot to learn and get familiar with.

## Getting Started
Prepare one page with introductory info about me and a paginated photo album.
### Prerequisites
Create an account on GitHub, create a repository for the About Me project.  
Start the README page with instructions to follow.  
Download Visual Studio Code.
Create the different files and pages (HTML, CSS, JS)
Read all the tutorials to understand the different langagues
Get familiar with the Command Line

### Installing
Getting familiar with the different languages and figure out how they are "related"
On Visual Code:
* Start an HTML document _(HTML5)_, write the plain content of the About Me page.
* Create the style sheet with a CSS document. Inser the reset to avoid any "preset" configuration.
  * Link it on the HTML doc.(make sure to put the right path)
  * Start to style the About Me page
  * Regular check to understand what is not working and fix it.
* Check BootStrap 

* Create a JS document
* Check JQuery

## Progress
### Text with HTML
* HTML: few attempts already.
  * Important to comment _<!-- This is a comment -->_ what you're doing
  * carefully check the syntax
  * Importance of the semantic
  * check online About Me pages to get ideas to make it appealing
  * Header/Navigation; three columns Life Path/Hobbies/Last but not least; Photo Album ; Footer
  
### Style with CSS
* CSS: few attempts already.
   * importance to comment _comment starts with /* and ends with */_
   * set the width of the body (responsive)
   * different ways to style the page with columns (float (need clearing after), grid)
   * Box Model and importance for the positionning of the content whithin the box and on the page.
   * Display property

## Versioning
Will Commit and pull request versioning be enough?
 
## Remarks
Text will be displayed in three equivalent columns
Album photo to be inserted in the second part of the page, pagination required
